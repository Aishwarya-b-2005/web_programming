        <h1>THE GOLDEN RETRIEVERS</h1>
        <div class="col"> 
            <p class="img">
                The Golden Retriever is a Scottish breed of retriever dog of medium size. It is characterised by a gentle and affectionate nature and a striking golden coat. It is a working dog, and registration is subject to successful completion of a working trial.[2] It is commonly kept as a pet and is among the most frequently registered breeds in several Western countries; some may compete in dog shows or obedience trials, or work as a guide dog.
                The Golden Retriever was bred by Sir Dudley Marjoribanks at his Scottish estate Guisachan in the late nineteenth century. He cross-bred Flat-coated Retrievers with Tweed Water Spaniels, with some further infusions of Red Setter, Labrador Retriever and Bloodhound. It was recognised by the Kennel Club in 1913, and during the interwar period spread to many parts of the world.

                <i>Characteristic: </i><br>
                The Golden Retriever is a powerfully built, medium-sized breed of dog; according to the Kennel Club breed standard, dogs stand from 56 to 61 centimetres (22 to 24 in) and bitches from 51 to 56 centimetres (20 to 22 in).[7][10] Healthy adult examples typically weigh between 25 and 34 kilograms (55 and 75 lb).[11]

                The Golden Retriever has a broad head with a well-defined stop, dark eyes set well apart, a wide and powerful muzzle, a large black nose, dark-pigmented and slightly drooping flews, and ears of moderate size set high and hanging with a slight fold.[11][12] The neck is muscular and fairly long with loose-fitting skin, the shoulders well laid-back and long-bladed, and the body deep through the chest with well-sprung ribs.[7][11][12] The back is usually level from withers to croup and the long, straight tail is usually carried flat, roughly in line with the back.[7][11][12] The forelegs are straight with good bone, the hind legs are powerful with well bent stifles and muscular thighs, and the feet are cat-like.[7][11][12]
                
                The double coat is a recognisable and striking feature:[9] the outer coat is long, flat or wavy and has good feathering on the forelegs, while the undercoat is dense and provides weather resistance.[11][12] The coat can be any shade of cream, yellow or gold; the coat typically becomes paler with age.[11][12] The Kennel Club breed standard prohibits red or mahogany-coloured coats, but a few white hairs on the chest are permitted.[10] Originally only yellow or golden coloured examples were permitted; this excluded many outstanding cream coloured dogs. To overcome this, in 1936 the Kennel Club's standard was amended to include the cream colour.[7] The cream colour, which in more modern times can be almost white, has become the dominant colour and is particularly favoured by conformation show exhibitors.[13] Golden Retrievers that are bred for conformation shows tend to have longer and finer coats than those bred for working as gundogs.[13]
                
                The Kennel Club breed standard is accepted by every kennel club in the world except those of Canada and the United States.[7] Breed standards in North America call for a slightly taller dog[note 4] and the cream colour is not permitted.[7]

                <i>Temparament:</i><br>

The Golden Retriever is considered an intelligent, gentle natured and very affectionate breed of dog.[4][9] As is typical with retriever breeds, the breed is generally calm and biddable, being very easy to train and extremely keen to please their master.[7][9] The breed is known to make excellent pets and family dogs, being generally extremely tolerant of children and keen to accompany any member of the family in a range of activities.[5] Due to their affable natures, the breed is often completely devoid of guarding instincts.[5] However, there have also been reports of some very aggressive Golden Retrievers in certain lineages. It has been suggested that these variations in aggression are partially caused by genetic factors.[15]

The breed usually retains many of their gundog traits and instincts including an excellent sense of smell and a strong instinct to retrieve; even among those not trained as gundogs it is typical for Golden Retrievers to present their owners with toys or other objects.[7][9] Compared to other retriever breeds the Golden Retriever is typically quite slow to mature
